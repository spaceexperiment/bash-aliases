Some aliases you could use to save you fingers from common commands.
Its best to place these in your ~/.bash_aliases
The git ones are easy to remember, g and the first letter of the command you will probably use, so 'gs' is just git status.

Give the ov command a python file, like this 'ov views.py'.

Will probably add more aliases.
Why not contribute with you favorite ones?
